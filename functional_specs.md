# BRAVO - Reporting (Functional)

## Overview

The goal of URP (unified reporting platform), is to take metrics from third parties, such as Dart (which in turn gets numbers from AdWords and Bing) and Marchex, and generate *unified* reports on them. Reports show metrics for some entities of interest (such as ad campaigns, or ad publishers), with various numbers (metrics) for each, including impressions, clicks, conversions, etc. One of the major motivating reasons behind the creation of URP is adding the ability to distribute fees across report metrics, as Dart does not do this for you today, making URP not only a helpful unified reporting engine, but an essential component in 10TH DEGREEâ€™s services offering. As such, the mechanism behind creating fees and applying them must be robust or it precludes the neccessity of URP entirely.

### Fees

There are two categories of fees we need to work with, **serving** and **agency**. There should be default value for fees within each category if no account level values are specified; this default should not expire.

#### Serving Fees

Fees incurred by utilizing a 3rd party ad server (e.g. DoubleClick) to track conversions across multiple channels, publishers, and placements. There are currently three kinds of serving ads, PPC (search), banner/flash ads (display), and video ads (display), but there may be others in the future. However, regardless of type, there are only two possible fees for each:

* CPM Fee (cost per 1000 impressions)
* CPC Fee (cost per click)

CPM is always computed using impressions, and CPC always using clicks.

For example:

* PPC
    * CPM Fee: E.g. $0.25 (per 1000 impressions)
    * CPC Fee: none
* Banner ads
    * CPM Fee: E.g. $1.00 (per 1000 impressions)
    * CPC Fee: E.g. $0.25 (per click)
* Video ads
    * CPM Fee: E.g. $1.00 (per 1000 impressions)
    * CPC Fee: E.g. $0.25 (per click)

In addition, valid date ranges for when to apply the sets of fees is needed. (e.g. 01/2001-01/2010) This allows a shcedule to be inputted for automatically incrementing fees.

Note that in the case both fees (CPM and CPC) apply, both must be added when the serving fee of that kind is used in a given calculation.

In the future, CPM may shift to a percentage of total spend instead, making it more like agency fees (see below).

#### Agency Fees

Fees charged by us for our services. For this we bill in tiers, usually charging less as more ads are served. However, there is also a minimum fee charged if not enough ads are served. Thus, we minimally have a table of:

* Range (number of impressions, e.g. "0-10000")
* Percentage of Spend (e.g. "15%")

So we know for what quanity of impressions, what percentage of the total spend to apply. However, if there were too few impressions, we want to default to a minimum management fee instead:

* Monthly Management Fee: E.g. $750

Similarly to serving fees, a valid date range for when to apply these fees is needed. (e.g. 01/2001-01/2010)

Like how serving fees has different sets of fees (e.g. "banner" and "video"), agency fees can have different sets as well, e.g. "display" and "search".

## Reports

Ultimately, a report (viewed by a user within URP) is composed of one or more rows and one or more columns, forming a grid with the entities of interest (e.g. campaign name, or publisher name) forming rows, and the metrics/stats forming columns. 

In order to create such a report, two things must happen:

1. Data must be provided from one or more *data sources*, and
2. There must be a configuration, or a *template*, for the report that specifies:
	1. what fields are present in the final report, and
	2. how to pivot the source data into the fields defined above.

Reports can optionally also have visual elements, such as pie, line, or bar charts.

### Data Sources

In order to provide data for a report, one or more data sources must be available.

Currently, only two data source types are needed:

1. Dart
2. Marchex

An instance of a data source is essentially responsible for returning a matrix of "reportable entities" with attributes. URP is designed around having metrics for specific datetimes and reportable entities (such as "ad campaigns" or "ad publishers"); therefore a data source must provide information on these two things so that its data can be combined with other data source data.

The system should be able to combine data from multiple data sources, including the following cases: 

1. when different data sources provide different attributes for the same entities
2. when different data sources provide the same attributes for the same entities (sum these values)
3. when different data sources provide the same attributes for different entities (e.g. a Bing data source returns stats for Bing campaigns, and an AdWords data source returns stats for AdWords campaigns)

However, different data sources will not always provide the same granularity of of metrics; the system must still be able to reconcile this, coalescing the data into the same report. For example, Marchex campaigns may only exist for publisher, but those numbers may need to be distributed across all the ad campaigns within each. In such cases, the system must provide a means for aligning data sources that provide different levels of granularity on reportable entities; further, a dependant field to be used in distributing the metrics provided by less granular data source(s).

#### Examples

##### Example 1: Multiple data sources, with varying granularity

Let's say we have the following data sources: Bing, AdWords, and Marchex. Bing and AdWords provide metrics by ad campaign. For Marchex, for bing-sourced campaigns, we only have a single phone number, whil for AdWords, we thought through the setup better and have one number per ad campaign. This means that for Bing, we need to take those phone calls and distribute all the calls proportionally (e.g. by # of clicks) across the Bing ad campaigns; for AdWords, on the other hand, we have a one-to-one mapping for ad campaigns with Marchex.

If we alter the example to instead want to report on keywords rather than ad campaigns, the Marchex numbers for both Bing and AdWords no longer match one-to-one. In this case, all of the numbers will need to be proportionally distributed; for Bing, this means taking the publisher level metrics from Marchex and distributing them across all Bing ad campaigns; for AdWords, this means taking the metrics from Marchex for each ad campaign, and distributing them across the keywords.

### Templates

Given that many clients will use the same reports, it is crucial that the system allow for configuring a report once and for it to be used by many clients; updating it should likewise apply to all clients using it.

A report template should be composed of fields, which will form the columns of the report displayed to the user. Fields should be specified in a manner similar to inputting formulae in an Excel spreadsheet. This makes defining a report template incredibly flexible. Some fields will come from data source attributes, and some will be formulae, e.g.:

```
#!javascript
spendWithFees = max(
    agencyFees("display").monthlyFee / row.totalDaysInMonth * row.monthDays,
    agencyFees("display").percentileMonth(sumMonth(impressions)) * sumMonth(spend))
```

Based on user permissions, different reports should be visible to the user.

Also, it may be desirable, based on user permissions, for fields in the report to be hidden/shown; this allows administrators to view reports with and without the agency/serving fees included, but for clients, to only show them included.

There must be a way to specify the formatting for fields, so that money can be formatted as money, whole numbers without decimal places, and fractional numbers with them (and with a configurable amount of precision).

### Viewing Reports

In the UI, the user selects from a list of reports they have permissions for, selects a date range (30 days, etc.) and then the system generates that report; hitting the data sources as needed to get the underlying data. 

#### Comparison (Trend) Reports

Comparison reports work exactly the same way, except the user either:

1. selects two or more date ranges (this may be done automatically, such as selecting the previous time period of the same type, e.g. 30 days, or last month), or
2. selects two or more accounts to compare to one another.

### Report Caching

Report data should be cached to prevent requesting the data repeatedly from the data sources.  

Each data source should also be schedulable to run at defined intervals (e.g. every day at 3am). We cache data from data sources rather than just caching the generated reports, because it allows us:

1. to reuse the same underlying data from a data source in multiple reports, and
2. to modify the report template and regenerate the report *without* having to re-request data from the data source.

## Phase 1.1

### Daily Reports

Upon completion of the existing customer facing reports, URP2 will need to deliver the daily report which is effectively and operational scorecard of every account. It is a report that combines two key measurement criteria:

1. MTD Budget vs. MTD Actual Spend
2. Rolling 7 Day Metrics (e.g. CTR, CPC, CPL) vs. Prior Period ROlling 7 Day Metrics

#### MTD Budget vs. MTD Actual Spend

This will require interacting with *Bravo Billing* to get the approved budget for each client account. Once we have the *budget* for a client, the report will take the monthly budget and divide it by the number of days in the month to get the on-track MTD budget. This will be compared to the actual spend (`media cost + ad serving + agency fees`) to see how close we are to being on budget. The report should highlight in RED any accounts off by more than 10%, yellow all accounts from 5-9.99%. These ranges should be configurable by account and a great feature would be that the ranges change relative to where we are in the month. Being off by 15% on day 2 isn't as bad as bing off by 15% on day 20.

#### Rolling 7 Day Metrics (e.g. CTR, CPC, CPL) vs. Prior Period ROlling 7 Day Metrics

The 7 DAY period is somewhat configurable or at least we have several options to choose from like 7/14/30 day.

# BRAVO - Billing (Functional)

Billing involves integrating client billing/invoices. Today we generate an Excel spreadsheet by hand that lists out "spend by month" for N months, showing numbers per network/placement, for both search and display. It also totals all media spend and compares it to the authorised spend amount. Given the right permissions, a user should be able to see this dashboard for an account / edit budget sums. Ideally, a client could log in and approve the budget amounts. Further, given another permission, a user should be able to see a list of all accounts, their current spend vs. their predicted spend (`approved spend / number of days in month * current day`), and the difference highlighted in red if it is over 5% different; this allows immediate action to be taken. In future phases we may want the system to adjust ad campaigns (such as pausing them) depending on how the predicted spend matches the actual spend so that we can as closely as possible, meet the approved spend amount.

Approved budgets are delivered by way of a Media Authorization Form (MAF) today. This MAF would need to have an interface with client login so they can use Digi-sign to approve the budget electronically. 

Using the [Quickbooks API](https://developer.intuit.com/docs/0025_quickbooksapi/0005_introduction_to_quickbooksapi) we could also automatically generate invoices to send the client.

## Users

### Administrators

* Can generate/edit proposed MAFs for an Account
* Can approve modified MAF from account user
* View list of accounts with approval status
* View list of accounts invoice status
* Need 2 views, dashboard to view status for all account and account level view.

### Account User

* Can respond to generated MAFs. (Approve, Deny, Modify)
* View proposed MAF
* View MAF previous months with actuals & future budget amounts
* Request Refunds

## Generate MAFs

Create a MAF for an account for N months and set Monthly budget for each budgeted item (will default values across all months with option to modify specific month)

Input budgeted items:

1. search
2. display
3. pre-roll
4. ...
 
Save. (Notify Account for Approval)

## Account Approval

### Declined or Modified

Moves back to generate MAF with updated values or declined with Reason.

### Approved

Account user accepts and e-signs MAF.

## Generates Invoices

X day of the N month generates invoice for N+1 month, if N+1 month has approved budget. Monitors new approved budgets till end of month generating invoices.


## Refund Balance

Screen to request remaining funds at the end of the month. If a user requests a refund in month N, then the user will be cut a check for the RolloverAmount amount in month N+1, after this has been calculated. If the RolloverAmount is negative the user will be refunded $0.

## Tracking Over/Under Spending

Account overflow is tracked by using actuals from month N-1. By storing the SUM of `budgeted - actual` into month N+1 RolloverAmount.

When budget amount for a month is requested it uses the budgeted SUM of all items + RolloverAmount. Which the RolloweverAmount may be positive or negative.

In the case the budget amount for a month of a particular item is requested, it uses the budgeted item plus the percent of the budgeted item over the total budget times the RolloverAmountThat is to say, `budget item + (budget item)/(SUM of all items) * RolloverAmount`
